## NovaOryn distribution note

NovaOryn 0.0.97 reissues this notice as part of the incremental ChangedFiles payload. The embedded framebuffer glyph data continues to carry the DejaVu/Bitstream provenance and licensing terms above; reissuing the notice repairs installations where a prior incremental archive did not contain this required repository-root file.

## Linux kernel console fonts

NovaOryn's optional Linux-kernel console font pack obtains the following bitmap font tables from the upstream Linux kernel and converts them byte-for-byte into PSF2 glyph storage for the NovaOryn framebuffer console: VGA 8x8, VGA 8x16, VGA 6x11, Sun 8x16, and Sun 12x22.

Upstream repository: `https://github.com/torvalds/linux`

Pinned upstream commit: `a13307e97d5c54b65720bb71fa379960ded1e51a`

Upstream paths: `lib/fonts/font_8x8.c`, `font_8x16.c`, `font_6x11.c`, `font_sun8x16.c`, and `font_sun12x22.c`.

Each of these upstream source files identifies its license as `GPL-2.0`. The downloaded source tables and generated PSF2 files remain GPL-2.0 third-party material. They are installed under `.toolchain/Fonts/LinuxKernel` and are not represented as NovaOryn-owned font data.

## FatFs

NovaOryn 0.35.21 includes a selectable C#/.NET-compatible port/adaptation of the FatFs filesystem model and portability boundary. FatFs is Copyright (C) ChaN and is distributed under its permissive BSD-style license. The selectable project carries `LICENSE-FatFs.txt`. The base NovaOryn kernel does not include or install the FatFs provider unless the end user selects it.
